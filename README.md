# OhConstantinePlay

This repository hosts a simple HTML/CSS project. A lightweight validator script is included to check basic HTML and CSS syntax.

## Running Tests

Use the provided `npm` script to validate `index.html` and `style.css`:

```bash
npm test
```

The command runs `python3 validate.py` and exits with a non-zero status if errors are detected.

The hero section now includes a banner explaining that the countdown timer tracks the time remaining to donate to our Seed & Spark campaign.
